 <h1>The Best Movies according to Guian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Intertellar</h3>
<p>The beautiful cinnematography and complex plot with the exploration of the universe and the tackle into the sience of both, the black hole and time relativity, alongside the theme of hope and family make this one of the greatest movies, in my opinion, of all time.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Once again the theme of hope takes us in a journey that makes you root for our protagonist even with the uncertainty of his innocence, the themes surrounding how one mistake or possibly incorrect verdict can take your life away and the indoctrination to life behind bars make for an incredibly compelling story.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>A revolutionazing film for its time, that throws any and all expectations out the window, every time you think you know what's coming next you're greatfully surprised by the twists and turns the plot takes, from the action, the thrills to the comedic moments, this movie is airtightly packed with scenes that will cement it as an unforgettable film and amazing experience.</p>
